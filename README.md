# Password-Generator

### On this homework assignment I was able to work on creating a random password generator.

### It was definitely a challenge to do, but I was able to get the help needed to complete it. Therefore allowing me to create a working version of it that can be seen here.

### In order to utilize it you will need to pick a password length of 8-128 characters no more, no less.
### After that you will be prompted if you would like to have lowercase letters, uppercase letter, numbers, or even symbols in your password. 
### You do have to select at least on of the prompts in order to generate the password otherwise you will be sent through the prompts again.
